This is my implementation of sentiment analysis based on tweets considering _The Social Dilemma_ movie. The dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/the-social-dilemma-tweets
There are 3 classes of tweets: positive, neutral and negative opinions about the movie. The goal is to create a machine learning model, which would classify tweets whether they are positive, neutral or negative.
I've tested 2 approaches of NLP transformation. The first one is the concept of _Bag Of Words_ (BOW), where the order of the words in the sentence doesn't matter. In this approach I've created my own vocabulary based on the words in tweets in the dataset. WORK IN PROGRESS
